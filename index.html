        <h2 class="i18n">Working towards better Financial Health</h2>
        <p class="i18n" id="w_1">
            Becoming organized financially requires some amount of
            discipline. Financial management can become complicated when there
            is no clear understanding of how much money we are getting,
            regarded as income as opposed to our expenses which is how much
            money we spend. Debt usually results when our cash flow is
            restricted because our expenses exceed our income. Then we need to
            borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable us to purchase our
            necessary items.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n" id="w_2">
            Then we need to borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable
			us to purchase our necessary items.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n" id="w_3">
            The first step towards better Financial Health, is to maintain
            good financial records. It is only when we have a clear
            understanding of where our money goes, that we can make an informed
            decision of where to cut back on our expenses when our cash flow
            becomes tight. If we do need to borrow money, we can then better
            manage our debts as well.
        </p>

            Did you realize you spent $600 in buying DVD movies last year?
            How many times did you watch them? Do you think now that the $600
            would have been better spent on the unexpected maintenance on the
            auto that came up yesterday? Of course there is no right or wrong
            answer to how you should spend your money. After all, it is you who
            earned that money and the right to spend it whichever way you see
            fit. But you can always make your money work harder for you.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n" id="w_5">
            Here's where personal finance software comes in. They help you
            slice/dice the financial data to give you better insight into what
            is going on. Always remember the software can only be as good as
            the data it has to process. Garbage In Garbage Out. But if you have
            started thinking of even using Personal finance software, you are
            well on your way to making every dollar count.

        <h2 class="i18n">Working towards better Financial Health</h2>
    <p class="i18n" id="w_1">
        Becoming organized financially requires some amount of
        discipline. Financial management can become complicated when there
        is no clear understanding of how much money we are getting,
        regarded as income as opposed to our expenses which is how much
        money we spend. Debt usually results when our cash flow is
        restricted because our expenses exceed our income. Then we need to
        borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable us to purchase our
        necessary items.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="w_2">
        Then we need to borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable
        us to purchase our necessary items.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="w_3">
        The first step towards better Financial Health, is to maintain
        good financial records. It is only when we have a clear
        understanding of where our money goes, that we can make an informed
        decision of where to cut back on our expenses when our cash flow
        becomes tight. If we do need to borrow money, we can then better
        manage our debts as well.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="w_4">
        Did you realize you spent $600 in buying DVD movies last year?
        How many times did you watch them? Do you think now that the $600
        would have been better spent on the unexpected maintenance on the
        auto that came up yesterday? Of course there is no right or wrong
        answer to how you should spend your money. After all, it is you who
        earned that money and the right to spend it whichever way you see
        fit. But you can always make your money work harder for you.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="w_5">
        Here's where personal finance software comes in. They help you
        slice/dice the financial data to give you better insight into what
        is going on. Always remember the software can only be as good as
        the data it has to process. Garbage In Garbage Out. But if you have
        started thinking of even using Personal finance software, you are
        well on your way to making every dollar count.

    <h2 class="i18n">Money Manager Ex Concepts</h2>
    <p class="i18n" id="concept_1">
        Money Manager EX models the real world to help us maintain our
        personal finances.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="concept_2">
        Generally we receive money from someone for a service we
        provide, or a product that we sell. This is regarded as Income or
        as a Deposit to our system. When we purchase an item or use a
        service, the money that we spend is regarded as an expense or
        Withdrawal to our system. In MMEX, the people that give us money or
        receive our money are regarded as the Payees of the system.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="concept_3">
        As we hopefully do not spend all the money we receive, we would
        obviously need a place to keep our money. This is generally, some
        financial institution, or several institutions or in our pocket.
        MMEX tags these places as Accounts.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="concept_4">
        When we spend or receive money, we see this as a
        transaction&gt;, and the reason for our income or expense is our
        category. There will be times where we need to transfer money from
        one place to another, such as a withdrawal from an ATM, and this
        type of transaction is known as a transfer.
    </p>
    <table class="table, small">
        <tr>
            <td class="i18n" id="concept_5">This can be simplified as shown in the following diagram:</td>
            <td><img id="mmex_concept" alt='MMEX Concept' src='img/mmex_concept.png'></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <script>
        var lang = getParameterValue("lang").substring(0, 2);
        var img_path = "img/mmex_concept.png";
        if (lang == 'ru')
            img_path = "img/mmex_concept_ru.png";
        else if (lang == 'po')
            img_path = "img/mmex_concept_po.png";
        else if (lang == 'hu')
            img_path = "img/mmex_concept_hu.png";
        document.getElementById('mmex_concept').src = img_path;
    </script>
    <p class="i18n" id="concept_6">
        One other important thing to consider is the currency we use to
        perform the transactions.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="concept_7">
        With all of these things to keep track of, MMEX uses a database
        to store and connect all these entities together.
    </p>
    <h3 class="i18n">Recommendations</h3>
    <p class="i18n" id="rec_1">
        The database that MMEX generates, known as the .mmb file,
        becomes an important file for you to maintain. Depending on
        circumstances, security features such as encryption can be
        employed, which is recognized as a .emb file. This is where we can
        attach a password to the database, and will require a password
        every time MMEX is opened.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="rec_2">When encrypting your database, Don't forget your password.</p>
    <p class="i18n" id="rec_3">
        As with any computer system, the data we produce is important to
        us, and therefore need to safeguard against system malfunction.
        MMEX has a backup system where it can produce a dated copy when the
        database is opened, and/or produce a dated copy of the database
        when changes have been detected. Up to 4 backups are maintained for
        each database when the system is initialized and/or when system
        changes have been detected, and the system shuts down.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="i18n">Always backup your .mmb or .emb database file regularly.</li>
        <li class="i18n">Always keep backup copies on other devices to protect against hardware failure.</li>
        <li class="i18n" id="rec_4">
            When upgrading to a new version of MMEX, make sure you
            backup your .mmb or .emb database file before doing so.
        </li>
        <li class="i18n" id="rec_5">Use the Menu Tools&rarr;Options... to set up the level of backup required.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2 class="i18n">Creating a New Database</h2>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_1">
        When MMEX initially starts up, it will attempt to load the last
        database that was opened. If no database existed, the user is
        presented with the option to either open an existing database, or
        create a new one.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_2">
        If you need to create a new database file, from the Menu, Select
        File&rarr;New Database.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_3">
        This will prompt you to specify a new name for your .mmb
        database file, at the location you specify. Your new database file
        is now created and the New Database Wizard will be displayed to
        help you initialize the new database and assist in creating your
        first account.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_4">
        The New Database Wizard will request you to set the Base
        Currency and a User Name.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_5">
        MMEX comes with a default set of currencies which you can use,
        to correspond to your countries currency settings. New accounts
        will then use this Base Currency setting as the default. This
        allows accounts from different countries to reflect the value in
        the base currency.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_6">
        To help identify the purpose of the database, a User Name is
        requested. This is optional, as it is only used as a title on the
        Home Page, and in reports.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_7">
        Both these settings can later be changed if required by
        selecting the menu: Tools &rarr;Options
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_db_8">
        The database name will be displayed on the title bar which helps
        remind you which database file is open.<br>
        The new .mmb database file is not encrypted.
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h2 class="i18n">Creating New Accounts</h2>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_1">
        When creating a new database file, you will automatically be
        requested to create a new account.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_2">
        To manually create a new account, from the Menu, Select
        Accounts&rarr;New Account.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_3">
        This will bring up the Add Account Wizard. The wizard will
        assist in collecting the important information of the Name and Type
        of Account. The Type of Account is not changeable, but the name can
        changed when editing account information.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_4">
        Name of the Account: This is a required field. The
        recommendation is to name your accounts uniquely and in relation to
        real world accounts. Example: With CitiBank, we have a Savings
        account and a credit card Visa account. You could name your
        accounts as ;CitiBank Savings; and ;Citibank Visa;.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_5">
        Type of Account: MMEX currently supports three types of
        accounts:
    </p>

    <h3 class="i18n">Checking Account</h3>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_6">
        This is the most common type of account used for MMEX, and
        can handle most common account types, such as checking
        accounts, savings accounts, and credit card accounts. Also
        known as Bank Account, and supports three kinds of
        transactions. These are withdrawal, deposit and transfers.
    </p>
    <h3 class="i18n">Term Accounts</h3>

    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_7">
        Similar to Checking Accounts with the exception that they
        appear in their own section on the home page and can be shown
        or hidden for normal day usage. For a better explanation see
        the account setup example.<br>
     </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_8">
        These kinds of accounts cover specialized accounts such as Cash
        Term Accounts, Bank Mortgage accounts, Loan accounts, or
        investment accounts with regular income or expenditure that you
        need to keep track of. These accounts have their own balance
        section on the Home Page. These accounts also, supports three
        kinds of transactions.
    </p>
    <h3 class="i18n">Investment Account</h3>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_9">
        The other type of account that MMEX supports is an
        ;Investment; Account. This type of account allows you to track
        stock/bonds/mutual funds investments and possibly other
        investments you may own.
    </p>

    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_10">
        To properly setup accounts, you should have balance information
        for the accounts you want to add to MMEX. You can get this
        information from your most recent bank, investment and credit card
        statements. To track additional information about this account,
        optionally you can enter your account details such as Account
        Number, Held At, Website, Contact info and Access Info. You can
        enter additional notes about the account in the notes field.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_11">
        Most accounts have some kind of balance in them, for example say
        in a credit card account, you have a current balance of $2304.67,
        you could put that value in the initial balance field. Going
        forward you only need to add transactions beyond that date when you
        had the balance.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_12">
        The Account Status can be set to ;Open; or ;Closed;. Closed
        accounts are just that. They are no longer active. Setting this
        status is just a way to de-clutter your view in your tree view
        navigation pane. Permanent settings are made by changing the View
        Options on the Menu, Tools&rarr;Options, you can hide the closed
        accounts. See Tips on Navigation Tree<br>
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_13">
        Currency: This is initially set to the database Base Currency
        setting which was initially set when creating the database. You can
        set the currency that is associated with this account and can be
        different to the base currency.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_14">
        The exchange rate for the currency can be changed using the
        menu: Tools &rarr;Organize Currency
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_15">
        Example: You live in the USA using US Dollars, and have an
        Italian bank account using the Euro. Most of your accounts are in
        USD. What is the real value of your Italian bank account? By
        changing the exchange rate for the Italian Euro, you can get the
        correct value of your accounts.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="new_acc_16">
        You also can mark accounts as a 'Favorite Account'. This again
        is used to change the accounts that are visible in the navigation
        bar. See Tips on Navigation Tree

        <h2 class="i18n">Working with Categories</h2>
        <p class="i18n">
            Categories indicate the reason an expenditure is made or an
            income is received.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">
            A Category is generally used to record Income or Expenses.
            Because MMEX allows us to transfer money between accounts, it is
            also recommended to use categories to record transfers. This will
            allow us to determine what money is being transferred for a
            specific reason, such as a repayment to a loan. This will not be
            seen as an income or expense in the overall picture. Using the same
            category for an income and an expense will upset balance
            figures.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">
            Example: If we want to record the the value of running a car, we
            would set up the following:<br>
            Category: Car,<br>
            Subcategory: Fuel, Maintenance, Registration, Insurance, Fuel Reimbursed<br>
            The first 4 subcategories are used to record expenses. If we are
            reimbursed for fuel costs for any reason, we would need to use Fuel
            Reimbursed as an Income subcategory. This would then allow us to
            determine the correct amount we are spending on fuel to run the
            car. This will become clearer when we are using Budgets.
        </p>

        <h3 class="i18n">Split Categories</h3>
        <p class="i18n">
            When adding a new transaction, we can use more that one category
            to record a transaction. This is known as a split category.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">
            The overall split category transaction is either a withdrawal or
            a deposit. Although the categories within the split, need to
            reflect the overall transaction type, each category can be
            classified as a withdrawal or deposit within the split.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">
            Split categories can easily be viewed for a transaction by using
            a pop-up menu selection when a split category entry exists.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">
            Note:<br>
            Withdrawal Screen: Deposits are displayed as negative.<br>
            Deposit Screen: Withdrawals are displayed as negative.

        <p class="i18n">Managing Our Categories</p>
        <p class="i18n">
            You can manage Categories by using the menu item:
            Tools&rarr;Organize Categories.<br>
            Once the category dialog opens, you can add new categories and
            subcategories.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">To Add a new Category:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="i18n">Select Categories at the root of the tree (At the top)</li>
            <li class="i18n">Type the new category name into the text box</li>
            <li class="i18n">Use the the Add button</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="i18n">
            The new category will appear at the bottom, and will be resorted
            when the dialog box is re-opened.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">To Add a new Subcategory:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="i18n">

        </ol>
        <p class="i18n">
            You can also change the names by selecting the
            category/subcategory in the list , modify the name in the text box,
            then use the Edit button. Use a similar action to delete the
            category/subcategory in the list.

        <p class="i18n">
            Note: You cannot delete categories which are being used by any

            Ensure that no transactions use this category/subcategory,

            </a>.<br>
            <br>
            To start-up WebApp you only have to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="i18n">
                unzip file in a folder on your webserver or upload files

        <h2 class="i18n">Importing From QIF Files</h2>
        <p class="i18n">
            Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) is an open specification for
            reading and writing financial data to media (i.e. files). A QIF
            file typically has the following structure:<br>
            <br>
            !Type:type identifier string<br>
            [single character line code]Literal String Data<br>
            ...<br>
            ^<br>
            [single character line code]Literal String Data<br>
            ...<br>
            ^<br>
            <br>
            Each record ends with a ^ (caret).<br>
            See example QIF transaction<br>
            <br>
            !Type:Bank Header<br>
            D6/ 1/94 Date<br>
            T-1,000.00 Amount<br>
            N1005 number<br>
            PBank Of Mortgage Payee<br>
            ^ End of transaction<br>
            <br>
            QIF is older than Open Financial Exchange (OFX). The inability to
            reconcile imported transactions against the current account
            information is one of the primary shortcomings of QIF. It is
            commonly supported by financial institutions to supply
            down-loadable information to account holders.<br>
            <br>
            MMEX can import transactions from specific types of QIF formats
            into an account.<br>
            <br>
            The types are the following: (You can find the type of QIF by
            opening in a text editor)<br>
            !Type:Bank Bank account transactions<br>
            !Type:Cash Cash account transactions<br>
            !Type:CCard Credit card account transactions<br>
            <br>
            Important Note (1): The date format option has to match that of the
            date format in the QIF file, otherwise, date parsing by MMEX will
            fail and will result in transactions having incorrect dates.<br>
            <br>
            Important Note (2): After importing from QIF, all transactions will
            have a ;Follow Flag; as it its status. You can mark all
            transactions with this flag using the bulk status setting commands
            using the right click menu in the account view.

        <h2 class="i18n">Importing From Universal CSV Format</h2>
        <p class="i18n">
            To alleviate the problem of users having to pre-format their
            bank transaction CSV files into the fixed format MMEX requires,
            MMEX also allows users to import CSV files where the order of
            fields is completely freeform. To use this importer, select the
            account you want to import into and then select the order of fields
            in the CSV file by picking and choosing from the list of possible
            fields. MMEX will now import the CSV file using the format
            information specified by the user. MMEX can import from a wide
            variety of formats. One of them is a fixed format CSV file. This
            file format exactly matches the CSV format that MMEX can export. So
            it can be useful to move data from one .mmb database file to
            another .mmb database file. To easily see the format of the CSV
            file, you can try exporting an account to a CSV file and then
            analyzing the format created.<br>
            <br>
            The CSV field options are as follows:<br>
            Date - Date of the transaction (In the format specified in
            Options&rarr;DateFormat)<br>
            Payee - To whom the transaction was made. In the case of a transfer
            transaction, this indicates the name of the account from which the
            transfer was made or to the account the transfer was made.<br>
            Amount (+/-) - The transaction amount. If it is a positive value it
            is a deposit, negative value is a withdrawal (there is an option to reverse this).<br>
            Category - The category of the transaction<br>
            SubCategory - The subcategory of the transaction<br>
            Notes - Transaction Notes<br>
            Number - Transaction Number<br>
            Withdrawal - An +ive amount that is considered as a withdrawal. (Do
            not use if specifying Amount (+/-))<br>
            Deposit - An +ive amount that is considered as a deposit. (Do not
            use if specifying Amount (+/-))<br>
            Don't Care - Ignore this field<br>
            <br>
            Note that the transactions from a CSV file can only be imported
            into a single MMEX account.<br>
            <br>
            Important Note (1): The date format option has to match that of the
            date format in the QIF file, otherwise, date parsing by MMEX will
            fail and will result in transactions having incorrect dates.<br>
            <br>
            Important Note (2): After importing from QIF, all transactions will
            have a ;Follow Flag; as it its status. You can mark all
            transactions with this flag using the bulk status setting commands

            <li class="i18n">
                When creating your CSV file be sure that you remove the
                commas from your deposits and withdrawals. This can be done
                easily through a program such as Excel or OpenOffice Calc.

        <ul>
            <li class="i18n">
                Or you can change the delimiter to be used by MMEX by
                choosing Tools&rarr;Options and changing the ;Import/Export
                Settings; in the ;General; option settings.

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="i18n">
                You do not need to include balance values in your CSV
                File.

            MMEX can export to a fixed format CSV file. This file format
            exactly matches the CSV format that MMEX can import. So it can be
            useful to move data from one .mmb database file to another .mmb
            database file. To easily see the format of the CSV file, you can
            try exporting an account to a CSV file and then analyzing the

            Payee - To whom the transaction was made. In the case of a transfer
            transaction, this indicates the name of the account from which the
            transfer was made or to the account the transfer was made.<br>
            Transaction Type - This can either be ;Withdrawal; or ;Deposit;<br>
            Amount - The transaction amount as a positive value<br>
            Category - The category of the transaction<br>
            SubCategory - The subcategory of the transaction if any (otherwise

        <h3 class="i18n">What's the reason for the EX in the name of the software?</h3>
        <p class="i18n">
            Originally I developed a personal finance software called Money
            Manager. It was written in .NET and more of a learning exercise
            than serious software development. It grew far beyond the original
            design. The software was frozen and work began on a new version
            which had a similar user interface and features, but written in
            C++.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">
            Usually Microsoft names their second version of their improved
            software APIs with an Ex extension as in doSomething() and
            doSomethingEx(). So I just followed the model and tacked on a 'Ex'
            to the end.

                    means that the .mmb file is a regular SQLite database.
                    SQLite is one of the smallest, free relational database
                    systems around and there are tons of tools to open and
                    access SQLite databases. SQLiteSpy and SQLite Browser
                    (http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/) are two such
                    utilities. Once you open the database using these tools,
                    you can do anything you want with the data.

            MMEX is a portable application which means ability to run

        <p class="i18n">
            Generally, with any closed source program, you have to depend
            upon the vendor's word regarding safety of the data. But with MMEX
            being open source, you can verify this claim yourself.<br>
            Even if you are not a C++ expert, you can rest assured that anyone
            can access the source code at any time and verify the legitimacy of
            MMEX's intentions.<br>
            MMEX does connect to the internet only to send anonymous usage
            statistics or when checking for an update.<br>
            You can disable this in Options-&gt;Network<br>

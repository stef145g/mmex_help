        <h2 class="i18n">Working towards better Financial Health</h2>
        <p class="i18n" id="w_1">
            Becoming organized financially requires some amount of
            discipline. Financial management can become complicated when there
            is no clear understanding of how much money we are getting,
            regarded as income as opposed to our expenses which is how much
            money we spend. Debt usually results when our cash flow is
            restricted because our expenses exceed our income. Then we need to
            borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable us to purchase our
            necessary items.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n" id="w_2">
            Then we need to borrow money to maintain our cash flow to enable
			us to purchase our necessary items.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n" id="w_3">
            The first step towards better Financial Health, is to maintain
            good financial records. It is only when we have a clear
            understanding of where our money goes, that we can make an informed
            decision of where to cut back on our expenses when our cash flow
            becomes tight. If we do need to borrow money, we can then better
            manage our debts as well.

            Did you realize you spent $600 in buying DVD movies last year?
            How many times did you watch them? Do you think now that the $600
            would have been better spent on the unexpected maintenance on the
            auto that came up yesterday? Of course there is no right or wrong
            answer to how you should spend your money. After all, it is you who
            earned that money and the right to spend it whichever way you see
            fit. But you can always make your money work harder for you.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n" id="w_5">
            Here's where personal finance software comes in. They help you
            slice/dice the financial data to give you better insight into what
            is going on. Always remember the software can only be as good as
            the data it has to process. Garbage In Garbage Out. But if you have
            started thinking of even using Personal finance software, you are
            well on your way to making every dollar count.

	<h2 class="i18n">Money Manager Ex Concepts</h2>
	    <p class="i18n" id="concept_1">
            Money Manager EX models the real world to help us maintain our
            personal finances.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">
            Generally we receive money from someone for a service we
            provide, or a product that we sell. This is regarded as Income or
            as a Deposit to our system. When we purchase an item or use a
            service, the money that we spend is regarded as an expense or
            Withdrawal to our system. In MMEX, the people that give us money or
            receive our money are regarded as the Payees of the system.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">
            As we hopefully do not spend all the money we receive, we would
            obviously need a place to keep our money. This is generally, some
            financial institution, or several institutions or in our pocket.
            MMEX tags these places as Accounts.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">
            When we spend or receive money, we see this as a
            transaction&gt;, and the reason for our income or expense is our
            category. There will be times where we need to transfer money from
            one place to another, such as a withdrawal from an ATM, and this
            type of transaction is known as a transfer.
        </p>
        <table class="table, small">
            <tr>
                <td class="i18n">This can be simplified as shown in the following diagram:</td>
                <td><img alt='MMEX Concept' src='img/mmex_concept.png'></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p class="i18n">
            One other important thing to consider is the currency we use to
            perform the transactions.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">
            With all of these things to keep track of, MMEX uses a database
            to store and connect all these entities together.
        </p>
        <h3 class="i18n">Recommendations</h3>
        <p class="i18n">
            The database that MMEX generates, known as the .mmb file,
            becomes an important file for you to maintain. Depending on
            circumstances, security features such as encryption can be
            employed, which is recognized as a .emb file. This is where we can
            attach a password to the database, and will require a password
            every time MMEX is opened.
        </p>
        <p class="i18n">When encrypting your database, Don't forget your password.</p>
        <p class="i18n">
            As with any computer system, the data we produce is important to
            us, and therefore need to safeguard against system malfunction.
            MMEX has a backup system where it can produce a dated copy when the
            database is opened, and/or produce a dated copy of the database
            when changes have been detected. Up to 4 backups are maintained for
            each database when the system is initialized and/or when system
            changes have been detected, and the system shuts down.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="i18n">
                Always backup your .mmb or .emb database file
                regularly.
            </li>
            <li class="i18n">
                Always keep backup copies on other devices to protect
                against hardware failure.
            </li>
            <li class="i18n">
                When upgrading to a new version of MMEX, make sure you
                backup your .mmb or .emb database file before doing so.
            </li>
            <li class="i18n">
                Use the Menu Tools&rarr;Options... to set up the level of
                backup required.
            </li>

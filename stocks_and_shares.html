    <h2 class="i18n"><strong>Stocks, Shares and Share Dividend Management in MMEX</strong></h2>
    <p class="i18n">
        The terms <strong>Stocks</strong> and <strong>Shares</strong> generally mean the 
        same thing but depending on how we use these terms, could mean something 
        different. Here we refer to 
        Stocks as companies, and Shares as units of value within the 
        company. Generally we would obtain Stocks via a Stock Broker and purchase or 
        sell shares in the company.</p>
    <p class="i18n">
        Initialising Stocks and Shares is initially a two stage process.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p class="i18n">
                First we create the Stock Entry and the associated Share Account.<br />
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="i18n">
                We add the initial Shares information to our Share Account.<br />
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="i18n">
        Any subsequent transactions involving Share movements is accessed via the 
        company in the Stock Portfolio view.</p>
    <p class="i18n">
        Any transaction associated with our normal accounts is done via the Account View using the associated Shares 
        Account.</p>
    <h3>
        <strong>Creating a Stock Portfolio for our Stocks</strong></h3>
    <p class="i18n">
        In order to use Stocks and Shares in MMEX, we need to create an account of type: <strong>Investment</strong></p>
    <p class="i18n">
        The name 
        for this account would generally be the name of the Stock Broker. In our example 
        we have selected the stock broker being called: <strong>Yahoo Finance</strong>.</p>
    <p>This account would appear in the navigation tree under the heading <strong>Stock Portfolios. </strong>&nbsp;When 
        we expand the <strong>Stock Portfolios</strong> branch in the navigation 
        tree, we would see our newly created Stock Portfolio account.</p>
    <p>Selecting our new 
        account Yahoo Finance opens the view: <strong>Stock Portfolio: Yahoo Finance.</strong>&nbsp; 
        In this view we can now add the stocks that we own.</p>
    <h3>
        <strong>Adding Stocks to our Stock Portfolio</strong></h3>
    <p>
        We refer to Stocks as the companies that we have purchased shares.</p>
    <p>
        Let us say that we purchase shares in two companies from out stock broker <strong>Yahoo Finance</strong>, we would create new entries in the stock portfolio view for our 
        companies.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>As an initial entry for each company we would supply the following</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Company Name</strong><br />
            Example: Alpha Corporation<br />
            This will also allow us to create a Share Account for this company of the same 
            name.<br />
        </li>
        <li><strong>Stock Symbol</strong><br />
            Example: APC.AX<br />
            [ APC ] being the Stock Exchange code,&nbsp;&nbsp; [ .AX ] being the Stock 
            Exchange to obtain current share value information<br />
        </li>
        <li><strong>Share Number</strong> being the initial number of shares<br />
        </li>
        <li>&nbsp;<strong>Share Price<br />
            </strong>This is the cost per share<br />
        </li>
        <li><strong>Commission</strong><br />
            This is generally the remaining value for incomplete shares<br />
            Example: Purchase of $1000.00 worth of shares at $2.35 per share, gives us 425 
            shares and $1.25 as commission.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:<br />
        </strong>The fields <strong>Date</strong>, <strong>Share Number</strong>, <strong>Share Price</strong> and <strong>Commission</strong> are duplicated for each share transaction that we enter.<br />
        The Date in the Stock Portfolio view becomes obsolete, and it is recommended that this field is hidden.</p>

                On saving this entry, the Share Account and Share Linkage can be set up.<br />
                Subsequent use of this dialog allows us to update the share price for this stock. When aditional shares have been purchased, this price will affect all shares.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Important: Save before close to keep any changes<br />

    <h3>
        <strong>Adding
        Initial Shares to our Stock</strong></h3>
    <p>
        Now that we have created the initial Stock entry, we need to Add a Transaction 
        to our Stock to create the initial Shares entry. The initial share information 
        is transfered to our new share transaction.</p>
    <p>
        Here we would add extra information similar to a normal transaction.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Account</strong><br />
            This would be the associated Share Account created when the Stock was initially 
            created. If this was not done, any other account can be used for this 
            transaction. In order to keep track of transactions, it is recommended that a 
            Share Account is created.</li>
        <li><strong>Type</strong> - Deposit or Withdrawal - Transfer<br />
            Withdrawal from the share account represents a deposit to the actual shares<br />
            Deposit from the share account represents a withdrawal to the actual shares<br />
        </li>
        <li><strong>Transfer</strong><br />
            All Share transactions are in effect transfers to and from actual share 
            investments depending on the transaction being a purchase or sale of shares.<br />
            If the transaction is required to be accounted as an expense or as income, we 
            would then remove the transfer selection.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
        <strong>Adding Subsequent Share Entries to our Stock</strong></h3>
    <p>Purchase or sale of shares is achieved by accessing the stock entry in the Stock 
        Portfolio view and adding new transaction.</p>
    <p>Here we need to add the share information and control the purchase or sale via 
        the transaction section of the share entry:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Share Purchase</strong><br />
            Transaction type is <strong>Withdrawal</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Share Sale</strong><br />
            Transaction type is <strong>Deposit</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2><strong>Stock Portfolio Account</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Our Stock Portfolio Account
        now displays a summary of the Stocks we have.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The stock broker name is used to define the Stock Investment name.</li>
        <li>The
        companies we buy shares from become the share name.</li>
        <li>Shares are generally associated with a Share
        Account having the same name as the company name.</li>
        <li>The Shares Accounts heading can be seen by using the menu item: <strong>View</strong> ---&gt; <strong>Display Share Accounts</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Example:<br />
        Companies&nbsp;Alpha Corp and Beta Corp maintain their accounts with Yahoo
        Finance.<br />
        Here we have hidden various headings as these become meaningless in this view.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>:<br />
        Initial share price is not listed in this view.<br />
        This is because the share price becomes meaningless in a summary view as each purchase will generally have a different share price.<br />

    <p>
        A Share account contain the transactions that are associated with this company stock.</p>
    <p>
        Initially we would set asside money for investment in Stocks and Shares. This is achieved by transfering money from our general accounts to a Share account.</p>
    <p>
        As shares are purchased and dividends recieved, we can now keep track of our investment over time.</p>
    <p>
        In a transactions, we can also use the company name as a Payee. It&nbsp; is also advisable to create categories of:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Share:
        Purchase</li>
        <li>Share: Dividend</li>
        <li>Share: Sale</li>

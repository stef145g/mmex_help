    <h2 class="i18n">Stock Portfolio or Managed Fund Accounts in MMEX</h2>
    <p class="i18n">
        In order to use Stocks, we need to create an account of type:
        Investment
    </p>
    <p class="i18n">This is maintained in the Navigation Tree under the heading: Stocks</p>
    <h3 class="i18n">Managed Fund Account</h3>
    <p class="i18n">
        A Managed Fund Account is where we only want to see the stocks that are held
        in a portfolio.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n">
        Here we can create entries
        for the companies maintained by the fund and allocate the shares as a percentage
        of the total shares.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n">
        Example: We have a Stock Account with three Companies having a 33% of
        the total unit allocations. If the total units or Shares are 1000, each company
        would hold 333.33 units
    </p>
    <h3 class="i18n">Stock Portfolio Account</h3>
    <p class="i18n">
        Initially, this is the same as a Managed Fund Account. The Stock Portfolio Account
        extends the Managed Fund Account concept by adding Share Accounts to maintain
        transactions for the specific Share Name. Here the number of shares are
        expressed as whole units. As a result we can record our initial share purchases,
        extended share purchases or sales as well as recording the dividends we recieve
        from the shares.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n">
        The stock broker name is used to define the Stock Investment name. The
        companies we by shares from become the share name, with an associated Share
        Account name the same as the Share Name.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n">
        Example:<br />
        Companies&nbsp;A, C and E maintain their accounts with Google
        Finance.<br />
        We create an account Google Finance and specify the type as
        Investment.<br />
        Using the
        Google Finance Account, we create New entries for:<br />
        Company A having 500 shares,
        Company C having 200 shares and company E having 300 shares.
    </p>
    <div class="row">

    </div>

    <h2 class="i18n">Share Accounts in MMEX</h2>
    <p class="i18n">
        As seen in the above screen, we can hide the Purchase Date,
        Unit Price and Price Date columns as these
        become obsolete.<br />
        We then create Share Accounts using the same name as the
        Share Name
    </p>
    <p class="i18n">
        Because a Shares account maintains the transactions for the company in our Stock
        account, we need to associate the share name to our share account.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n">
        For each Share Name and its associated Share Account we need to set the
        initial transaction for the account. This is done as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li class="i18n">Use Add Trans from the Stock Portfolio view</li>
        <li class="i18n">
            The first transaction needs to use the default values in the
            Stock Investment Details section
        </li>
        <li class="i18n">Subsequent transactions need to provide the necessary details.</li>
        <li class="i18n">The missing transaction details need to be provided.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="i18n">
        As for all transactions, we can also use the company name as a Payee, which
        we can create. It&nbsp; is also advisable to create categories of Share:
        Purchase, Share: Dividend, Share: Sale and income: Share Dividend
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-1"></div>
        <img alt="Stock_shares for Google Finance" src="img/Stock_shares.png" />
    </div>

    <h3 class="i18n">Share Accounts</h3>
    <p class="i18n">
        These accounts do not display on the Home page as these accounts
        are assistants to the Stock Account. Share accounts become part of the general
        accounts functionality section. Transfers to general accounts are handled the
        same as general accounts. Transfers to Stock accounts behave differently. These
        accounts can also have money being directly deposited and withdrawn as the case
        for Dividend transactions. By accessing the Stock Account directly, the
        transactions for the account can be seen. The current visibility of Stock
        Accounts on the navigation page may change as further development occurs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="i18n">Adding Shares to our Share Accounts</h2>

    <p class="i18n">
        The addition of Shares is done from the Stock Investment screen by selecting the
        company entry. This is done using the button: Add Trans
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-1"></div>
        <img alt="adding shares to account" src="img/Stock_add_to_share_account.png" />
    </div>

    <ol>
        <li class="i18n">
            The number of shares is populated from the created entry on the
            Stock Investment screen. Subsequent addition of shares are manually
            entered. These shares are then added to the share count on the Stock
            Investment screen.
        </li>
        <li class="i18n">
            On the transaction side, any account name can be selected.
            Suggest that a share account be created with the same name as Note 2.
        </li>
        <li class="i18n">
            For a share purchase, money obtained for Stocks would be a
            withdrawal from general accounts. This money is classified as a
            Transfer. The Transfer checkbox allows us to treat this
            transaction as a withdrawal from the general accounts section. We
            can also set this to become a Deposit for the case when recording
            dividend payments, or a deposit transfer in the case of share sales.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="i18n">
        Subsequent use of this screen allows us to add further transactions
        such as Dividend payments, More share purchases in the case when we have
        a Dividend Reinvestment Plan in operation. The DRP allows us to convert
        dividends to extra shares, without the use of a stock broker.
    </p>

    <h3 class="i18n">Use of Share Accounts</h3>
    <ol>
        <li class="i18n">
            The use of a Share account is highly reccomended.<br />
            Money can be transfered into&nbsp; or out of&nbsp; of these accounts
            without affecting the general accounts balance.<br />
        </li>
        <li class="i18n">
            Creating a new transaction from a Share account will connect
            directly to the general accounts.<br />
        </li>
        <li class="i18n">
            Money can be deposited or withdrawan from a Share account which
            will affect the balance, or it can be transfered into or out of the
            Share account.<br />
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="i18n">
        Note: Future access to the shares accounts may be accessed via the
        Stocks Account in future.
    </p>

    <h2 class="i18n">Adding Dividends to our Shares</h2>
    <p class="i18n">
        Using the Add Trans dialog, we are able
        to add dividend payments to our individual share accounts
    </p>
    <p class="i18n">
        Note: The dialog will not display any share information
        when opened a second time on a share account.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="i18n">
            Adding more shares, requires the addition of share
            information as well as the payee and category information.
        </li>
        <li class="i18n">
            Adding Dividends, share information is set to 0 and
            the type is set to Deposit.
        </li>
        <li class="i18n">
            The Transfer checkbox can be unticked for
            the transaction to become an Income on Deposit.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="i18n">
        Examination of the individual Share Accounts will
        display the transactions for the shares and dividends.

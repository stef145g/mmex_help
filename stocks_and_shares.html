            The terms <strong>Stocks</strong> and <strong>Shares</strong> generally mean the
            same thing but depending on how we use these terms, could mean something
            different.
        </span>
        <span class="i18n" id="ssd_002">
            Here we refer to
            Stocks as companies, and Shares as units of value within the
            company. Generally we would obtain Stocks via a Stock Broker and purchase or
            sell shares in the company.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="ssd_003">
        Initialising Stocks and Shares is initially a two stage process.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p class="i18n" id="ssd_004">
                First we create the Stock Entry and the associated Share Account.

        Any subsequent transactions involving Share movements is accessed via the

    <h3 class="i18n">Creating a Stock Portfolio for our Stocks</h3>
    <p class="i18n" id="ssd_008">
        In order to use Stocks and Shares in MMEX, we need to create an account of type: <strong>Investment</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="ssd_009">
        The name
        for this account would generally be the name of the Stock Broker. In our example
        we have selected the stock broker being called: <strong>Yahoo Finance</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="ssd_010">
        This account would appear in the navigation tree under the heading <strong>Stock Portfolios. </strong>&nbsp;When
        we expand the <strong>Stock Portfolios</strong> branch in the navigation
        tree, we would see our newly created Stock Portfolio account.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="ssd_011">
        Selecting our new
        account Yahoo Finance opens the view: <strong>Stock Portfolio: Yahoo Finance.</strong>&nbsp;
        In this view we can now add the stocks that we own.
    </p>
    <h3 class="i18n">Adding Stocks to our Stock Portfolio</h3>
    <p class="i18n" id="ssd_012">
        We refer to Stocks as the companies that we have purchased shares.
    </p>
    <p class="i18n" id="ssd_013">
        Let us say that we purchase shares in two companies from out stock broker <strong>Yahoo Finance</strong>,
        we would create new entries in the stock portfolio view for our
        companies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="i18n" id="ssd_014">
            <strong>As an initial entry for each company we would supply the following</strong>:

            <span class="i18n" id="ssd_015"><strong>Company Name</strong></span><br />

            <span class="i18n" id="ssd_017">
                This will also allow us to create a Share Account for this company of the same
                name.

            <br />
        </li>

            <span class="i18n" id="ssd_019">Example: APC.AX</span><br />
            <span class="i18n" id="ssd_020">
                [ APC ] being the Stock Exchange code,&nbsp;&nbsp; [ .AX ] being the Stock

            <span class="i18n" id="ssd_023">
                Example: Purchase of $1000.00 worth of shares at $2.35 per share, gives us 425

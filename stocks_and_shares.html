<h2><strong>Stocks and Shares</strong></h2>

<hr />
<p><span class="h2"><strong>Stock Portfolio or Managed Fund Accounts in MMEX</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>In order to use Stocks, we need to create an account of type: 
Investment</strong></p>
<p>This is maintained in the Navigation Tree under the heading: Stocks</p>
<p><span class="h3"><strong>Managed Fund Account</strong></span></p>
<p>A Managed Fund Account is where we only want to see the stocks that are held 
in a portfolio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here we can create entries 
for the companies maintained by the fund and allocate the shares as a percentage 
of the total shares.</p>
<p>Example: We have a Stock Account with three Companies having a 33% of 
the total unit allocations. If the total units or Shares are 1000, each company 
would hold 333.33 units</p>
<p><span class="h3"><strong>Stock Portfolio Account</strong></span></p>
<p>Initially, this is the same as a Managed Fund Account. The Stock Portfolio Account 
extends the Managed Fund Account concept by adding Share Accounts to maintain 
transactions for the specific Share Name. Here the number of shares are 
expressed as whole units. As a result we can record our initial share purchases, 
extended share purchases or sales as well as recording the dividends we recieve 
from the shares.</p>
<p>The stock broker name is used to define the Stock Investment name. The 
companies we by shares from become the share name, with an associated Share 
Account name the same as the Share Name. </p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
Companies&nbsp;A, C and E maintain their accounts with Google 
Finance.<br />
We create an account <strong>Google Finance</strong> and specify the type as
<strong>Investment</strong>.<br />
Using the 
Google Finance Account, we create New entries for:<br />
Company A having 500 shares, 
Company C having 200 shares and company E having 300 shares.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="h2"><strong>Share Accounts in MMEX</strong></span></p>
<p>As seen in the above screen, we can hide the <strong>Purchase Date,</strong>
<strong>Unit Price</strong> and <strong>Price Date</strong> columns as these 
become obsolete.<br />
We then create <strong>Share Accounts</strong> using the same name as the
<strong>Share Name</strong></p>
<p><strong>Because a Shares account maintains the transactions for the company in our Stock 
account, we need to associate the share name to our share account.</strong></p>
<p>For each Share Name and its associated Share Account we need to set the 
initial transaction for the account. This is done as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Use Add Trans from the Stock Portfolio view</li>
	<li><strong>The first transaction needs to use the default values in the 
	Stock Investment Details section</strong> </li>
	<li>Subsequent transactions need to provide the necessary details.</li>
	<li>The missing transaction details need to be provided.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;As for all transactions, we can also use the company name as a Payee, which 
we can create. It&nbsp; is also advisable to create categories of Share: 
Purchase, Share: Dividend, Share: Sale and income: Share Dividend</p>

<span class="h3"><strong>Share Accounts<br />
<br />
</strong></span>These accounts do not display on the Home page as these accounts 
are assistants to the Stock Account. Share accounts become part of the general 
accounts functionality section. Transfers to general accounts are handled the 
same as general accounts. Transfers to Stock accounts behave differently. These 
accounts can also have money being directly deposited and withdrawn as the case 
for Dividend&nbsp; transactions. By accessing the Stock Account directly, the 
transactions for the account can be seen. The current visibility of Stock 
Accounts on the navigation page may change as further development occurs.<br />
<hr /><br />
<span class="h2"><strong>Adding Shares to our Share Accounts<br />
</strong></span><br />
The addition of Shares is done from the Stock Investment screen by selecting the 
company entry. This is done using the button: <strong>Add Trans</strong><br />
<table style="width: 100%">

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<ol>
			<li>The number of shares is populated from the created entry on the 
			Stock Investment screen. Subsequent addition of shares are manually 
			entered. These shares are then added to the share count on the Stock 
			Investment screen.
			</li>
			<li>On the transaction side, any account name can be selected. 
			Suggest that a share account be created with the same name as Note 
			2.
			</li>
			<li>For a share purchase, money obtained for Stocks would be a 
			withdrawal from general accounts. This money is classified as a 
			Transfer. The Transfer&nbsp; checkbox allows us to treat this 
			transaction as a withdrawal from the general accounts section. We 
			can also set this to become a Deposit for the case when recording 
			dividend payments, or a deposit transfer in the case of share sales.
			</li>
		</ol>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Subsequent use of this screen allows us to add further transactions 
		such as Dividend payments, More share purchases in the case when we have 
		a Dividend Reinvestment Plan in operation. The DRP allows us to convert 
		dividends to extra shares, without the use of a stock broker.</td>

			Money can be transfered into&nbsp; or out of&nbsp; of these accounts

			<li>Creating a new transaction from a Share account will connect

			<li>Money can be deposited or withdrawan from a Share account which
